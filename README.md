# Bagels
This is simple practice from a newbie in python. (Lots of effort should be paid for improvment.)
The practice is from the book "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" and created by myself. 

Gagels is a deductive logic game and the player need to guess the secret three-digit number based on clues. The player have 10 tries to guess the secret three-digit number.

Clues:
Pico : a correct digit in the wrong place
Fermi : a correct digit in the correct place
Bagels : no correct digits
